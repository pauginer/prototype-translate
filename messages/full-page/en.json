We want the process of learning how to edit to be trivial, so our volunteers, both new and experienced, can devote themselves to what they edit. That's why we're building the visual editor, so that contributing to a wiki is as easy and natural as other modern editing systems, and new editors are not dissuaded from making their changes.",
