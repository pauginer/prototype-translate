He created an influential twentieth century architectural style, stated with extreme clarity and simplicity. His mature buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and <a href=\"/wiki/Plate_glass\" title=\"Plate glass\" class=\"mw-redirect\">plate glass</a> to define interior spaces. He strove toward an architecture with a minimal framework of structural order balanced against the implied freedom of free-flowing open space. He called his buildings \"skin and bones\" architecture. He sought a rational approach that would guide the creative process of architectural design, but he was always concerned with expressing the spirit of the modern era. He is often associated with his quotation of the aphorisms, \"<a href=\"/wiki/Minimalist_architecture\" title=\"Minimalist architecture\" class=\"mw-redirect\">less is more</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/wiki/God_is_in_the_detail\" title=\"God is in the detail\">God is in the details</a>\"."},
